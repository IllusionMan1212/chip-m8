# chip-m8
Basic Chip-8 emulator written in C++ using SDL2 as the graphics and sound library.

# Building
You will need both the SDL2 development and SDL2 Mixer libraries installed on your machine (consult your OS).


Run cmake in the repository directory and then run `make` if you're on linux or build with Visual Studio if you're on Windows.
I only tested with linux, so no guarantees a visual studio project will be built with cmake
